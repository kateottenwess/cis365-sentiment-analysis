totally marvelous do not attempt to slander me i have not insulted you whatsoever as you perfidiously suggest i just pointed out accusing me of sockpuppetry its as easy to make as accusing you of disruptive misconduct it is you who are continuously assuming i am a sockthingy and thus questioning my very existence as an independent human being now this is totally insulting
so i guess we just have to wait for ikedanobuo to be an idiot again
i can answer some of that yes wikipedia is user editable just like imdb odd as it sounds wikipedia itself is not considered a reliable source for another wikipedia article i have looked at the main article on film commissions and you are correct that it is rife with problems at this moment there are 3448062 articles on wikipedia and only a few thousand active editors who actually work with content so sometimes an article like this slips through i have already begun editing it to fix some of these problems the article draft you have presented above is by no means the worst thing i have ever seen posted on wikipedia but it seems this commission has not received significant attention from reliable sources this is the reason it is not acceptable ive been through kamploops myself it is an unusaul area one doesnt expect to see desert so far north but until the commission itself manages to get coverage in multiple sources that are entirely independent from it and have a reputation for factchecking and accuracy it will not be an acceptable subject for a wikipedia article regardless of whether other flawed articles also exist now that we have established this is there any other topic you would be interested in writing about if you have interests other than this one article your latest name suggestion seems fine and you could probably be unblocked if you agree not to attempt to repost an article on the tnrd until it undeniably meets our minimum standards for an article

 thanks for uploading or contributing to imagethai domestic passenger ticketjpg i notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in wikipedia articles constitutes fair use in addition to the boilerplate fair use template you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use suggestions on how to do so can be found  here 

 please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale using one of the templates at wikipediafair use rationale guideline is an easy way to ensure that your image is in compliance with wikipedia policy but remember that you must complete the template  do not simply insert a blank template on an image page  

 if you have uploaded other fair use media consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too you can find a list of image pages you have edited by clicking on the  link it is located at the very top of any wikipedia page when you are logged in and then selecting image from the dropdown box note that any nonfree media lacking such an explanation will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded as described on criteria for speedy deletion if you have any questions please ask them at the media copyright questions page thank you    "

 but numbers are used not only in japan but in china korea vietnam etc please look at digital typhoon typhoon names asian names

 mecu  thank you for adopting me awhile back i am now active again on wp and have a question for you i have been working within my area writing a new article and it is coming along but as i have been surfing through the various areas my article is within i have found some things that either a do not belong in a given category examplehttpenwikipediaorgwikistonesetting  this should not be under jewellers but instead under either jewellery or something related to the act of making jewelry  or b something that should be deleted example httpenwikipediaorgwikifireiceretail

 the ideal ratio is zero  that is zero firstparty references at least for things that relate to claims of notability  for academics its not always going to happen but get as close as you can even if it means greatly reducing the scope and size of the article  basically barring gotta have it things like year of birth and year of death if its not important enough that someone else has written about it then its not important enough to put in wikipedia  the article on nobelprizewinning immunologist rolf m zinkernagel is on the short end of acceptable for a nobelprizewinner but it would be about the right size for a scientist whose contributions to mankind were somewhat less significant  notice that while it actually needs more references the things that need to be referenced in all but the last paragraph are almost certainly written about in independent secondary sources  email "

 i think you are right about occupy that is exactly the problem but as for this thoughmmm i dont think its something we should play with even in hopes of waking people up i dont think its really about copyright oh passing the law lets legislators please people who throw a lot of money around and thats always a happy thing for them obama is likely to sign it if it passes for much the same reason but remember when gas was around 175 a gallon not so long ago and then it went to four and then back down to two which was now low and a completely acceptable baseline that new proposed law at a quick glance may not be that much better although it does seem to preserve safe harbor so youtube will be safe as long as it responds to complaints in a timely manner theyll still be able to go after the wikileaks of the world though i think i just found out in that strike thread that the alternate proposal had draft language now maybe i will think otherwise once i take another look the language about tools is still in there it looks untouched thou shalt not hide from big brother the thing is i like a world that has open source software tools in it i will however give the sponsors of this bill credit for putting up a wiki for comment i told wnt id give him a hand so i guess i will figure out pretty soon what i think about that and comment if appropriate   "

  renaming  

 i see the term disk laser is not good because of many other meanings of the word disk 
 at least in english version of wikipedia how about other languages should we care of compatibility of terminology 
 making the english version of wikipedia 
 the term disk laser seems to appear first in the publication  

 by german colleagues who are not native english speakers 
 and this term does not correspond to the commnon meaning of word disk 
 i consider to rename the article to active mirror keeping disk laser as redirection

the question might equally be why are you repeatedly recreating the page im deleting  it was tagged as a copy vio didnt demonstrate its importance and read like blatant advertising

 delete it all of it 

 this site is racist rude and just flatout offensive i have never before seen such a hateful vulgar and slanderous excuse for a website in all my life ok so it is meant to be a satirical 
 take on wikipedia obviously due to its long lecturing paragraphs on innocuos objects like a condom or a pencil but this website is an abomination to all of mankind and 
 nothing other than a hateful trolling repulsive sickening iniquity den of lies graphic gore and racism it claims to be satirical it is time we got one thing straight 
 satire can be a take on other peoples beliefs religion and race and sometimes it can go too far but the bottom line is satirical comedy is meant to be funny and lets be frank 
 this is not funny at all i have never laughed once at any of the articles about britain america and most particularly the articles about jewish people which made me want to vomit 
 incidentially it seems that the creator whoever scum he might be has a personal vendetta among jewish people for example there is picture on the article about jewish people which 
 shows a jewish man eating what seems to be a dead baby with the caption jews eat babies there is also a page about adolf hitler with these madeup facts and positive comments 
 which makes him seem quite nice and im sure i dont need a second opinion on considering that this is just bullshit 
 this site takes the piss out of dead people men in wheelchairs and reoccurs racial slurs like nigger paki kike and many more nasty words 
 whoever this spam faced hatemongerer is i hope he hangs himself soon or as these pigs say selfpwn quickly before some very offended kikes find out where 
 he lives and slit his throat with their fingernails and post a picture of in on the site with a caption that says  we have taken girlvinyls throat and here it is now we go on 
 to take over the site  the jews  
 god i hate this site with a passion and a final message anyone who laughs at any article on that sorry excuse for a site is a nazi scum and should enjoy munching on 
 nick griffins greasy sausage when they go to hell"

"hello below is something i wrote a while back it describes the tech that the jews control now i love the jews but hate their ways so im not against the jews only those who try to turn me into a slave 

  hello this is a post to tell everyone what is really going on i posted previously about monodirectional mass displacement emc2 well here it is ill try to explain as simple as i can first i need to explain what this engine does answer  it is a space engine which allows users to move forward in one direction using nothing but electricity in the vacuum of space now to explain how it works just ask yourself if you ever looked a spinning record lp or a centerfuse and realized that the energy on the outer circumference of the lp or centerfuse is greater than the center as the object spins and the faster it spins the more energy is created now imagine you have a magnetic object attached to the outer circumference and you are able to release it easiest way it to use em throughout construction as the object is flung in a set curve now imagine you made 2 spinning records in opposite directions this is to counter the torque only as you fling these magnetic lets call them ball bearings simplest but other things can be used but remember in order to balance properly em must be employed throughout the machine so something magnetic must be used the more ball bearings released the greater the forward energy created this is done my simply slowing down the cascading bombardment of ball bearings using em due to the high level of friction created and if you want a space engine thats not going to strand you in space friction is going to be your main problem along with balance 

 i came up with this when i was 7 years old and because of my understanding of mechanical engineering i was employed by the us government to help them reverse engineer the engine from the wreckage from the 1940s weather balloon that uses this engine 

 the outer skin is carbon fiber nano tubes with an aluminum oxide coating diamond sheet i do not think i need to explain much further pretty simple to understand but if any of you guys have any questions please post them ill try to explain the best i can 

 also look at like a balloon because that is essentially what it is its light weight and filled with hydrogen just like a birthday balloon     
 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 below is black out top secret the government knew about this long ago but americans are the butt monkey of the world the jew fuck einstein said it very cryptic by calling it emc2 but it is an efficient space engine which would allow non jews to become the so called gods that the jews have been and is an inside joke because of the crude oil gasoline makes it impossible to think so the jews are already winning by killing americans by forcing them to in hail large amounts of gasoline fumes this over time leaves you weak and vulnerable to the jews slave labor credit 

 if you guys are about the right change you need to inform all your followers of this but if you slide this under the table me and many other super geniuses will declare you as also an enemy as the jews are and when the time comes you too will fail but if you are about empowering geniuses act now procrastination will lead to both of your down fall show us what you stand for if you are about reaching for the stars then below is how its done 
 act now or else adaptation
